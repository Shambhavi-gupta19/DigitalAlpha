Sectors : Banking, Healthcare and Transport clients

Alphacom deals in Banking sector which requires a large amount of security so the company should use private cloud as public cloud doesn't
provide good security. 

In Healthcare sector some data need to stored in private cloud and some in public cloud like medicine names and equipments name can be 
stored in public cloud whereas data of patient can be stored in private cloud.

Transport clients doesn't need that amount of security so public cloud can be used in this sector.

So Alphacom must use hybrid cloud in their organisation and Amazon's EC2 instances can be used as IaaS.
